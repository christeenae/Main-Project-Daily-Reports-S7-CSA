of time.

best possible idea that could be implemented as our final project. We selected three ideas from the whole list of ideas by the end of the period.

We further discussed about the three ideas and did some research on the ieee papers that was needed for gaining more knowledge on the different topics we selected. 
Three ieee papers were needed minimally for each of the main project ideas. Abstracts were needed for all the three main project ideas.These ieee papers were 
referred to create abstracts for the same.

The abstracts we created for our project was discussed with our project guide. Our project guide gave suggestions on the topic that was feasible to be implemented 
out of the three ideas that we came up with. The main project topic was finalised and a printed copy of the consent form regarding the main project was signed and
