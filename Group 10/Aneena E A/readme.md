<-----DAY 1 (10 Oct 2020)----->
We were teamed up to select three different ideas for our main project. So we all individually searched for the different ideas across the web all throughout the 
period to reach the final decision to be made on the project. We listed out all the different topics 
<-----DAY 2 (12 Oct 2022)----->
We filtered the ideas that were listed out previously by us in terms of feasibility, current knowledge of technological stack by our teammates etc to choose the
best possible idea that could be implemented as our final project. We selected three ideas from the whole list of ideas by the end of the period.
